So the society is wise iff most important agentâ€™s influence diminish with increase of society. THis is very important notion, society will fail to converge to truth if leader has too much power on forming opinions of others. In case of our example
Corollary Let g(n) be sequence of adjacency matrices. g(n) is wise 

$$\gamma_{n} = \frac{ 
\left | \left (\mathbf x_{n} - \mathbf x_{n-1} \right )^T 
\left [\nabla F (\mathbf x_{n}) - \nabla F (\mathbf x_{n-1}) \right ] \right |}
{\left \|\nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \right \|^2}$$
